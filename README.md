# iot-monitoring
An IoT project using MQTT protocol by Publisher-Subsribe method with Arduino UNO coupled with a DHT11 sensor (as Publisher) that monitors the temperature of cities and compares them using the Node-RED platform and Cloud Services (as Subscribers).

## 1 [Description]

This project was performed together with @ElisianePaixao, the master's student at Electrical Engineer - UFSC. We propose a weather monitoring system of cities to be presented in a discipline of the Automation and Systems Engineer Postgraduate Program. The main idea is to integrate at Node-RED platform, the IBM Watson or Google Firebase services to store data monitored by an Arduino UNO through the MQTT protocol by Publisher-Subscribe method.

For the sake of simplicity, we outline the linked technologies and how they can be processed in the figure titled 'architecture.png'. The technologies used are presented in Section 2 and the details from the architecture are described in Section 3. In Section 4, the Palettes that you need to run this project are demonstrated. Besides, the Arduino code is available in the DHT folder, the configuration of components and sensors used are described in Architecture's Section and better explained in the .pptx file. The flow can be imported for Node-RED through a copy of the JSON file.
