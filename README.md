# iot-monitoring
This is an IoT project with Arduino UNO that monitors the temperature of cities and compares them using the Node-RED platform and Cloud Services.

## 1 [Description]

This project was performed together with @ElisianePaixao, the master's student at Electrical Engineer - UFSC. We propose a weather monitoring system of cities to be presented in a discipline of the Automation and Systems Engineer Postgraduate Program. The main idea is to integrate at Node-RED platform, the IBM Watson or Google Firebase services to store data monitored by an Arduino UNO through the MQTT protocol by Publisher-Subscribe method.

For the sake of simplicity, we outline the linked technologies and how they can be processed in the figure titled 'architecture.png'. The technologies used are presented in Section 2 and the details from the architecture are described in Section 3. In Section 4, the Palettes that you need to run this project are demonstrated.
